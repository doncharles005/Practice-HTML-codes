The register.php file is the file with the registration code.
The registration.php file is also working, and it sends the user information to the MySQL database also.
The database is practice1, and the table is users.This can be set in http://localhost/phpmyadmin.

The registration forms are working. Let the user register in the register.php file, then then can login with the login.php form. 
This creates a session for the user. It has a link to logout.

This works if XAMPP is installed and Apache and MySQL are running.
